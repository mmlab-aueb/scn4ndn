## About
This is the github repository of the **Self-Certifying Names for Named Data Networking
(SCN4NDN)** project. The project investigates the application of self-certifying identifiers to
Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm. In particular it experiments with a self-managed
form of Decentralized Identifiers referred to as [did:self](https://github.com/mmlab-aueb/did-self)
applied to [Named Data Networking](https://named-data.net) architecture. For more information about
the project, visit the project's [homepage](https://mm.aueb.gr/projects/scnforndn).
